# Cooperscript
* Python-like scripting language, has Lisp/Java/Pascal qualities
* Sister language called Coopertags is like HTML, also used for config files
* Cooperscript is easier to learn than most of the popular languages, but somewhat less practical
# Info for contributors
* For detailed info, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, also if desired check out [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* Not quite ready yet to accept contributions (currently developing code execution of Cooperscript compiler)
* I am busy helping my friend run his perfume store, which supports E-commerce
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in 2022
* At this point I don't have much documentation for coders, but feel free to email me with your questions for now
