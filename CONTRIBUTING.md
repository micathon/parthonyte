# Contributing to Cooperscript
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Cooperscript contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in late 2020
* To view a list of tasks for contributors, please go to home page of [website](http://cooperscript.com), click on Steps
* Step 8 "While doing..." has several sub-tasks which are indented
* Those sub-tasks are where you can get started
* One task, writing unit tests, is something I've neglected since I graduated in 1984. They didn't teach us unit tests, and in my previous job my boss never required that particular coding task
* Contact me if you wish to write detailed design specs or anything more ambitious
* At this point I don't have much documentation for coders, just email me with your questions for now
# How to run Cooperscript
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java coop dotop > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/dotop.coop`: sample Cooperscript source code
  * `bin/out.txt`: used for debugging and logging what my code is doing
  * both `dotop` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
# Roadmap

# Contact Me
* Please send me an email, ask me anything, any comments are always welcome
* Expecting a tsunami of comments is like trying to be on the first page of Google w/o marketing or SEO, but at least I've now put the readme, contributing, and code-of-conduct files up on GitHub. Thanks again for dropping by.
