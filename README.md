# VaquaTalk
* Python-like scripting language, has Lisp/Java/Pascal qualities
* Sister language called VQML is like HTML, also used for config files
* In a nutshell, VaquaTalk mimics the functionality of Python, minus several advanced features, plus a simpler syntax
* Only Lisp has a simpler syntax than VaquaTalk, which is itself a straightforward language unlike Lisp and other oddball languages like SNOBOL and Forth
# Info for contributors
