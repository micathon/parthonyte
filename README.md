# Cooperscript
* Python-like scripting language, has Lisp/Java/Pascal qualities
* Sister language called Coopertags is like HTML, also used for config files
* Cooperscript is easier to learn than most of the popular languages, but somewhat less practical
* Used to build Android apps for the [Cooperscript](http://treenimation.net/cooperscript/) software hub
# Info for contributors
* For detailed info, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, also if desired check out [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* Not quite ready yet to accept contributions (recently finished developing syntax checker of Cooperscript compiler)
* I am busy helping my friend run his perfume store, which supports E-commerce
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in fall 2020 or winter 2021
* At this point I don't have much documentation for coders, just email me with your questions for now
