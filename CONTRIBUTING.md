# Contributing to DefunScript
* Many thanks for your interest in being a DefunScript contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in 2025
* Recruitment of contributors will commence after the console-mode version of the DefunScript compiler is working
# How to run DefunScript
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java dfns atest > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/atest.dfns`: sample DefunScript source code
  * `bin/out.txt`: used for debugging and logging what my code is doing
  * both `atest` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
