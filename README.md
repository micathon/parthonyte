# Themapole
* Python-like scripting language, has Lisp/Java/Pascal qualities
* Sister language called TPML is like HTML, also used for config files
* In a nutshell, Themapole mimics the functionality of Python, minus several advanced features, plus a simpler syntax
* Only Lisp has a simpler syntax than Themapole, which is itself a straightforward language unlike Lisp and other oddball languages like SNOBOL and Forth
