# Contributing to Knodathon
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Knodathon contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions probably not until early 2024
* Recruitment of contributors will commence after the console-mode version of the Knodathon compiler is working
* Knodemaker is the project which monetizes Knodathon, and its development will be crowdsourced
* No need to make use of the services or funding of an angel investor
# How to run Knodathon
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java knod atest > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/atest.knod`: sample Knodathon source code
  * `bin/out.txt`: used for debugging and logging what my code is doing
  * both `atest` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
