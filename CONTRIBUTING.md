# Contributing to Parvascript
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Parvascript contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions by end of 2021
* If you wish to write detailed design specs or anything more ambitious, please contact me
* At this point I don't have much documentation for coders, but feel free to email me with your questions for now
# How to run Parvascript
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java pvas dotop > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/dotop.pvas`: sample Parvascript source code
  * `bin/out.txt`: used for debugging and logging what my code is doing
  * both `dotop` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
